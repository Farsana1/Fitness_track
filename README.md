# **Fitness Tracker Website**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a Fitness Tracker website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The main objective was to familiarize myself with the MERN stack, as I was new to this technology. I built the website by following various tutorials, applying the concepts learned, and integrating them into a functional application.

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Activity Tracking**: Users can log their daily and weekly fitness activities, including workouts, steps, and calorie intake.
- **Progress Visualization**: Graphical representations of the userâ€™s progress over time using charts.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose for object data modeling)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## **Learning Process**

- **React.js**: Learned the basics of React, including components, state management, and hooks.
- **Express.js**: Understood how to create a backend server using Express, handle routes, and connect with MongoDB.
- **MongoDB**: Gained experience in setting up a NoSQL database, defining schemas, and performing CRUD operations.
- **Node.js**: Learned how to use Node.js for server-side scripting and integrating the frontend with the backend.

## **Challenges**

- **Learning Curve**: As I was new to the MERN stack, the initial learning curve was steep. However, by following comprehensive tutorials and building this project, I was able to overcome these challenges.
- **Integrating Components**: Understanding how the different parts of the stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) work together was key to successfully completing the project.
